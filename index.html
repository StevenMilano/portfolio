        <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
      
        <p>After graduating college, I was doing freelance design here and there while, also working at a rock climbing gym. I found that my intrest in how my designs were implimented started to grow.</p>

        <p>I started to teach myself how to code and after a while, I decided to become a student at Thinkful. Where I could really start learning how to become a software developer.</p>

        <p>Outside of design and software development, I am an avid climber and love to coach/teach. While working at my rock climbing gym I was one of the lead coaches helping young climbers. My other hobbies include:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Hiking</li>
          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Fermentation</li>
          <li>Photography</li>
        </ol>
